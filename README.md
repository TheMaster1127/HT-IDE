# HT-IDE

Write code once in the simple HTVM language. The IDE then transpiles it into popular languages like JavaScript, Python, or C++. Its core feature is a fully customizable text file that gives you complete control over the entire translation logic, making it uniquely flexible.

**WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT. THE CODE IS NOT COMPLETE!**
